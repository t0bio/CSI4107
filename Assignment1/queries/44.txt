<title>The Amount of Money Earned by Writers 

<desc>

Document must quote amount of money earned by writers as a
result of their writing efforts.

<narr>

Amount of money quoted may refer to money paid to a writer
for a single item, such as a book advance or a movie deal;
or may be cumulative over a period of time.  It may also
result from ancillary activities such as speaking 
engagements resulting from what they have written.
Writing in any medium is relevant.  A figure may also refer
to a range, such as an industry standard, instead of a 
particular payment.
