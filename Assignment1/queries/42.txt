<title>Oil Spill Cleanup 

<desc>Document will identify a method, procedure, or
chemical used in cleaning up oil spills such as the Exxon Valdez.  Only
oil spills on water (ocean, bay, lake, etc.) will be used.


<narr>

To be relevant a document will identify a method, procedure, or
chemical process used in cleaning up the water and beaches after a 
major oil spill, such as the Exxon Valdez incident.  The mere mention
of cleanup efforts without identifying the method or chemical used
is not relevant.  A document that refers to a procedure such as scrubbing,
spraying, etc. is relevant.  References to the cost of cleanup and number
of people and equipment involved without mentioning the method are
not relevant.
