<title>Financing AMTRAK 

<desc> Description:

A document will address the role of the Federal Government in
financing the operation of the National Railroad Transportation
Corporation (AMTRAK).

<narr>

A relevant document must provide information on the government's
responsibility to make AMTRAK an economically viable entity.  It
could also discuss the privatization of AMTRAK as an alternative
to continuing government subsidies.  Documents comparing government  
subsidies given to air and bus transportation with those provided
to AMTRAK would also be relevant.
