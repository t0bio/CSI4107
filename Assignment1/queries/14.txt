<title>Generic Drugs - Illegal Activities by Manufacturers 

<desc>

Document will report FDA or Congressional investigations concerning
illegal activities by generic drug manufacturers.

<narr>

To be relevant a document must identify a specific generic drug
company being investigated by the FDA or Congress.  It also must
identify the drug, i.e., the generic drug for Zantac.  A vague
reference to a type of drug, such as pain killer or muscle
relaxer is not relevant.  A general reference to generic drugs
and related problems (quality-control or drug scandals) without
specifics is not relevant.  Recalls of specific generic drugs 
that did not live up to FDA standards are relevant.  Disputes 
between drug manufacturers concerning the quality or sales of
generic versus name brand drugs including lawsuits are not
relevant.
