<title>English as the Official Language in U.S. 

<desc>

Document will provide arguments supporting the making of English 
the standard language of the U.S.

<narr>

A relevant document will note instances in which English is
favored as a standard language.  Examples are the positive 
results achieved by immigrants in the areas of acceptance,
greater economic opportunity, and increased academic
achievement.  Reports are also desired which describe some
of the language difficulties encountered by other nations
and groups of nations, e.g., Canada, Belgium, European
Community, when they have opted for the use of two or more
languages as their official means of communication.  Not 
relevant are reports which promote bilingualism or 
multilingualism.
