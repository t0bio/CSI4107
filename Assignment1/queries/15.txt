<title>Tobacco company advertising and the young 

<desc>

A document will provide information on what is a widely held
opinion that the tobacco industry aims its advertising at the
young.

<narr>

A relevant document must report on tobacco company advertising
and its relation to young people.  A relevant document can
address either side of the question:  (1) Do tobacco companies
consciously target the young, or (2) As the tobacco industry 
argues, is this an erroneous public perception.  The "young"
may be identified as youth, children, adolescents, teenagers,
high school students, and college students.
