<title>Oil Spills

<desc>

Document will identify major oil spills throughout the world.

<narr>

A relevant document will note the location of the spill, 
amount of oil spilled, and the responsible corporation,
if known. This will include shipborne accidents, offshore
drilling and holding tank spills, but should not include
intentional spills such as Iraq/Kuwait or leakage from
broken pipes.  References to legislation brought about 
by a spill, litigation and clean up efforts associated
with a spill are not relevant unless specifics of the
spill are included.
