<title>Legality of Medically Assisted Suicides 

<desc> Description:  Document will discuss a suicide that
is effected through the assistance of a medically competent
person -- doctor, nurse, medical technician etc.  -- and
the legality of such an assisted action.


<narr>A relevant document will discuss a
suicide that is effected through the assistance of a medically
competent person and the legal ramifications of such an
assisted action.  It should also include any undue influence,
such as counseling, suggestions, recommendations, and
preparation of medications by the medical person which would
incline the ill person to choose to commit suicide rather
than it being an independent and free personal action.
A suicide committed for health reasons, but as a totally
independent action free from any medical assistance, is not
relevant.
