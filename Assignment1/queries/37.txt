by publishers, from the sale or merger of their business or 
publication, or the sale of a significant interest in it to
another person or company.

A relevant document might describe the purchase of a publishing
house by a more diversified industry, the takeover of a small
publisher by a larger one, or the merger of two or more publishers
or publications.  The closing of a publishing house, subsidiary,
imprint, magazine, or newspaper would also be relevant.  In
