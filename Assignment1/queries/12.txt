<title>Automobile Recalls 

<desc>

Document will provide data that expands on the type and purpose of
recalls on vehicles manufactured by American or Foreign automobile
companies.

<narr>

A relevant document will provide data on the recall of vehicles to 
fix, modify, or replace defective components.  Relevant data would
include recall data on vehicles produced by American or Foreign
manufacturers and would include the name of the company, make/model
of the vehicle, and the purpose of the recall.  The numbers of 
vehicles involved is desired, but not essential.  Legal actions or
court decisions would also be desired, but are not necessary to be
relevant.  Trucks and buses should be considered the same as an
auto for the purpose of relevancy.  Not relevant would be suggested
recalls that have not been substantiated or ordered by the company
or Government.
