<title>Real Motives for Murder 

<desc>

Document must identify a murderer's motive for killing a
person or persons in a true case.

<narr>

Most relevant would be a description of an intentional 
murder with a statement of the murderer's motive.  An 
unintentional murder, such as in a charge of second-degree
homicide, would be relevant if a motive is stated for an 
action which clearly led to the victim's death.
