city, state, or federal government.  A document that reports 
garbage problems without referring to costs is not relevant.  
A document that reports penalties for not adhering to 
regulations is not relevant.  References to garbage/trash
removal as being "costly" or "expensive" without actual figures
are not relevant.  A document that identifies costs for 
recycling is relevant.  Documents that identify how much a
landfill site survey, furnace, etc. may cost without a 
specific purchase are not relevant.
