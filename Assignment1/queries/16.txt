<title>Standardized testing and cultural bias 

<desc>

A document must provide information on charges that standardized
testing of applicants to the college level is biased against
racial minorities, women, and the poor.

<narr>

In addition to a direct charge that standardized testing is
biased, a relevant document could report on the fact that the
average test scores for middle and upper class males are higher
than the average scores of blacks, Hispanics, women and the poor,
a fact that members of those groups interpret as evidence of 
bias.  Standardized tests include the PSAT, the SAT, the ACT, 
and any state-administered test.  Testing for the grant of
scholarships or for advanced placement would be relevant.  
Criticism of the make-up of the tests, efforts to change the
make-up of the tests, or the abandonment of the tests by
certain colleges would be relevant.
