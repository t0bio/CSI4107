<title>The Consequences of Implantation of Silicone Gel 
Breast Devices 

<desc>

Document will discuss the use of silicone gel breast implants
manufactured by Dow-Corning Corporation and recipient`s concerns 
regarding future medical problems that may occur as a result of
manufacturing defects or lack of proper testing before approval
for general public use.

<narr>

To be relevant a document must provide pertinent data on the
risks associated with silicone gel breast implants, including
identified residual effects.  Documents that identify Dow-Corning
Corporation as the manufacturer of the device are particularly
significant.  Statements issued by the FDA regarding implant`s
safety and reliability, and technological advances in testing
procedures to assist in the identification of future problem
areas are considered relevant.  

Pending or concluded litigation against the Dow-Corning 
Corporation which has been initiated by implant recipients is 
not relevant unless it provides a specific strategy of the 
Corporation to alert the public to the risks involved.  

Foreign government's actions regarding the use of
silicone gel implants are not relevant.
