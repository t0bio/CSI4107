<title>U. S. Restaurants in Foreign Lands 

<desc>

Document will identify those countries where U.S. fast food 
restaurant chains are now or will be located.

<narr>

A relevant document will identify the restaurant chain and
the specific country where the restaurant is now or will be
located.  Town locations are of interest but are not required
for relevancy.  Planned expansions are relative providing
specific negotiations with the country of interest are now
or have already taken place.  Relevancy requires the name of
a food associated restaurant chain, not just sales and
distribution of 'soft drinks' and 'snacks'.
