<title>Hazardous Waste Cleanup 

<desc>

Document will provide data on the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act known as the 
Superfund Hazardous Waste Cleanup Program.

<narr>

A relevant document would provide data on what is referred
to as the Superfund Hazardous Waste Cleanup Program.  Relevant
data would be in such areas as information on how much money
is in the approved EPA budget to support the Superfund; goals
and policies of the program; cleanup problems created by the
Superfund Law and associated costs, if known; numbers of sites
on the cleanup list; effectiveness of the program; as well
as actions taken in response to the Superfund Law.  Also 
relevant would be data on actions taken by the EPA to recover
costs as well as any court decisions made in response to 
Superfund actions.  Documents that discuss hazardous waste
operations in general with only reference to Superfund would  
be considered as not relevant.  Data on proposed budget dollar
figures as well as politically motivated statements on the
Superfund Program would not be relevant.
