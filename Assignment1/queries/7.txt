<title>Causes and treatments of multiple sclerosis (MS) 

<desc>

Documents will focus on studies as to causes of multiple sclerosis
and on research efforts to develop treatments and/or cures for it.

<narr>

This search will be somewhat limiting in that it focuses on one 
particular medical condition among a broader group which are 
thought to be caused by the auto-immune system.  Efforts will 
be directed toward finding any reports of new ideas of cause 
as well as elaboration on the auto-immune theories.  The search
will focus also on research efforts to find treatments to alleviate
the symptoms of MS and/or to discover possible cures for it.  The
names of companies involved and the particular drug or therapy 
should be a part of the relevant item.  Also relevant would be
non-medical or alternative healing procedures which find acceptance
among MS sufferers, e.g., bee venom, acupuncture, etc.
