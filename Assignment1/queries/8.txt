<title>Term limitations for members of the U.S. Congress 

<desc>

Documents will relate the issues involved in these controversial
proposals to try to place limits on the number of terms members
of Congress can serve consecutively.

<narr>

Any discussion of the subject of limiting the number of consecutive
terms a member of the U.S. House of Representative or a member of the
U.S. Senate may serve whether in editorials, letters to the editor,
news items, etc. is to be considered.  The search should consider
efforts which originate at Grass Root Level as Referenda, at the 
state level as discussions or even enactment of laws and at the
national level.  Integral to this search are the underlying U.S.
Constitutional Qualifications for a member of Congress.  Discussions
and arguments pro and con on just what effect interpretations of
the Constitution might have on term limitation efforts.
