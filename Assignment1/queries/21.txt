<title>Use of Mutual Funds in an Individual's    
Retirement Strategy 

<desc>

Document will discuss the role of mutual funds as an
investment alternative in formulating an individual's
retirement program.

<narr>

To be relevant a document will address the role/use of
mutual funds as an integral part of an individuals     
investment retirement program, including Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRA) which are assigned/designated.
The document must identify the specific type of fund; i.e., 
income, stock, bond, etc., the reason for its selection 
when compared to other types of funds available, and in 
concert with the needs and capabilities of the individual 
investor.  The names of individual funds, companies 
administering the funds or funds portfolio managers are 
not relevant unless they identify a unique option or 
feature not commonly available to the investor in other
financial programs utilized in retirement planning.
