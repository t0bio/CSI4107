<title>Vietnam Veterans and Agent Orange 

<desc>

While serving in South Vietnam, a number of U.S. Soldiers were
reported as having been exposed to the defoliant Agent Orange.
The issue is veterans entitlement, or the awarding of monetary
compensation and/or medical assistance for physical damages
caused by Agent Orange.

<narr>

Relevant documents will discuss veterans suffering from cancer 
and other ailments allegedly caused by Agent Orange; the 
document will also relate the awarding of compensation to the
veteran, or the veterans attempt to obtain compensation.
Documents which discuss medically ailing children born to a
veteran who had been exposed to Agent Orange are also relevant.
Official studies are relevant, but articles which simply 
reference the Agent Orange problem are not relevant.
