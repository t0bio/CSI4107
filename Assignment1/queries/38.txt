<title>Beachfront Erosion 

<desc>

Document will identify instances of beach erosion anywhere in
the U.S. and what, if anything, is being done to prevent its
repetition.

<narr>

To be relevant, a document will identify a specific location
and whether the erosion was natural or storm related.  Procedures
implemented to replenish current beaches and to preclude or
minimize future instances of erosion would also be relevant.
Identification of funds, regardless of source, for use on 
specific beaches or areas would be relevant as well as  
identification of any local, state or federal legislative 
action(s) restricting use of affected areas, erosion of
farmland and along rivers and related stream banks is
not relevant.
